<!-- CREATED WITH THE HELP OF CHATGPT: I used AI to help me understand my code. Although AI helped me with the code,
I made sure that every part of the code I wrote was understood. I used the combination of the skills we learned in class of HTML
with the help of AI to help upload my resume! I created the resume.html as well as resume.css (styles). Once again, although AI
did help me, I made sure to understand and simplify the code as much as possible in order to successfully incorperate understanding
of HTML code!
The only parts I did not really understand was the code of "<meta" and the code of "<hr"
everything else I was able to learn about AS chat gpt was writing the code as well as youtube or lecture videos!-->
