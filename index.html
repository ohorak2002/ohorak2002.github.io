            <p></p>
                My mission is to pursue a career that aligns with my passion of helping others,
                communicating with people, and making new connections. I hope to be dedicated in this
                career and hopefully find these values in wherever I work. I aim to be known for my
                commitment, integrity, and positive impact on others because these are some of the
                qualities I try to uphold!

                    My Affinity Diagram shows different ways to limit the power of AIâ€”through laws,
                    human control, safety measures, education,
                    and responsibility so technology stays helpful and under human guidance.

                        My main sketch follows my Problem Statement and shows a organized way to create an app that seperates each page 
                        with a "strategy" for solving my problem with AI overtaking technology. Second page accesses the strategies button and then
                        you are able to select the individual strategies on the other pages (each with different information)
